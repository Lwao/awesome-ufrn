\section{CONCLUSIONS}

Despite its downgrades, the OFDM system is very promising in future communications systems and show very good results in actual applications in the wireless market. The benefits of a high data capacity, high spectral efficiency and resilience to interference as a result of multipath effects provide some of the pillars that every communications scheme need today.
