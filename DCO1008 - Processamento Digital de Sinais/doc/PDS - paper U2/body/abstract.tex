Regarding the rising importance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in recent communication systems, this work explains how an OFDM signal can be synthesized with the use of the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of which efficient implementation is the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT).
