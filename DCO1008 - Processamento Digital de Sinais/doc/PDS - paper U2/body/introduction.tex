\section{INTRODUCTION}

\par Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
has become a popular technique for transmission of signals
over wireless channels. Due to the benefits of this modulation technique, OFDM is used in several applications ranging from cellular systems, wireless local area networks (WLANs) and even optical light modulation. Regarding that, this article intends to explain the reason for using this technique, especially over wireless channels, and how it works.
