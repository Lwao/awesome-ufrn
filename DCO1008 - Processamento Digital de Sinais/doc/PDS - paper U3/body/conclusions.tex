\section{CONCLUSIONS}

Despite its downgrades, the OFDM has a powerful successor considering the f-OFDM scheme. Its potential to keep a even more restricted bandwidth was proved in the results of this paper.

The f-OFDM system is very promising in future communications systems such as the 5G and other applications in the wireless market. The benefits of a high data capacity, high spectral efficiency and resilience to interference as a result of multipath effects provide some of the pillars that every communications scheme need today.
