\section{Low noise amplifier: matching for noise}

This problem uses a NXP LNA model BGU6104. The objetive of this section is to compare matching networks for maximum power deliverance with networks to minimum noise figure.

The simulation imports the model as a quadripole with both ends terminations of $50 \Omega$ (optimal source impedance) and performs a S-param type simulation from 100 MHZ up to 3.5 GHz. It is important to point out that the model represents $V_{cc} = 3V$ and $I_{cc} = 6mA$, so we guarantee a solid basis of comparison between practical results and the datasheet.

There is a section showing dynamic characteristics in the BGU6104 datasheet, such as insertion power gain and minimum noise figure at a given frequency. So this values will be compared with the results of simulation in a proper table.

The first variable to compare is the insertion power gain $|s_{21}|^2$ which is represented in the plot of figure \ref{fig:lna1}. Extracting the equivalent values from the datasheet, we obtain the table \ref{table:1} with results very close to each other.

\label{fig:lna1} 
\end{figure}

\input{tables/table1}


The second variable for analysis is the noise figure $NF$ and the minimum noise figure $NF_{min}$ as shown in the plot of figure \ref{fig:lna2}. Since there is no matching networks in this first circuit, the noise figure is way above its minimum, needing a matching for noise to reduce it towards the minimum. The table \ref{table:2} show the comparison results for the minimum noise figure with close values meaning that good results were obtained in the simulation.

\end{figure}

\input{tables/table2}

Despite the results match with the datasheet, however they does not represent intended characteristics in a practical application. Analysing at 2 GHz, we have the following results in the simulation e.g. $|s_{21}|^2 = 12.494 dB$, $NF = 1.659 dB$, $NF_{min} = 1.051 dB$, meaning that with a proper matching network either the insertion power gain can be improved (power matching) at 2 GHz or the noise figure can be reduced towards the minimum (noise matching). 

The first step to design the matching networks is to visualize the values of $s_{11}$ and $s_{opt}$ in the smith chart of figure \ref{smith:1}. Using the input impedance associated with $s_{11}$ we can design a matching network to maximize power, but using the one associated with $s_{opt}$ we can design a matching network to minimize the noise figure. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{smith:1} 
\end{figure}

So, aiming a max. power matching it was designed a L network whose would consider the input impedance $5.2-j1 \; \Omega$ as in figure \ref{smith:1}. The L network for min. noise matching was designed using the $s_{opt}$ correspondent conjugate impedance of $16-j5 \; \Omega$ as in figure ref{smith:1}.

The figure \ref{fig:match} show both results for a matching network to achieve max. power transference \ref{fig:match}(a) and min. noise figure \ref{fig:match}(b). In \ref{fig:match}(a) the insertion power gain of 17.1 dB is higher than the previous value of 12.49 dB denoting a good matching network. In the case of figure \ref{fig:match}(b) the noise figure perfectly matches with the minimum value at the given frequency.

\label{fig:match} 
\end{figure}

It is the designer choice to define if the circuit will care with a power matching or a noise matching, once that it has to bear in mind the objective and flaws of one's application.
